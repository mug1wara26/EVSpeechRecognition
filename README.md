# EVSpeechRecognition
## What is this for?
This was a school project where users can use voice commands to control a EV3 robot.
## How does it work?
Using the turtle module, a series of lights is flashed for a light sensor to detect the number of times the light has flashed. Then with that number, different commands can be sent to a separate robot.
## How do I use this?
1. Download evSpeechRecognition.py
2. Edit evSpeechRecognition.py to include the voice commands you want, make sure each command has a different number of flashes
3. Run the code
4. Place the turtle window in a preferred corner on your computer
5. Set up a light sensor to detect changes in the turtle window
6. Have the light sensor communicate with another robot and send commands to that robot based on the number of light flashes
